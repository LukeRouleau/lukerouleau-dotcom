            <p>I recently picked up a 50th anniversary vinyl of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4LH4d3cOWNNsVw41Gqt2kv">Dark Side of the Moon</a>, 
            and it's reminded me that it is the single greatest album ever recorded. If you have never spared yourself the 43 minutes to listen to it start to finish, 
            and for the love of god not on shuffle, do it. If you cannot spare 43 minutes, then meditate on how wrongly you're living your life if you cannot spare 43 minutes 
            to listen to the greatest album ever recorded.</p>
