            <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
            <p>We make thousands of decisions every day, from the mundane to the momentous. Yet we rarely step back to examine our decision-making process itself. How can we make better decisions? What mental models can guide us toward wiser choices?</p>
            
            <p>One of the most impactful realizations is that not all decisions deserve equal attention. Some decisions are reversible – these can be made quickly. Other decisions are nearly irreversible or have long-lasting consequences – these deserve more careful deliberation.</p>
            
            <h2>Decision Journaling</h2>
            <p>Another powerful practice is decision journaling. By recording the context, assumptions, and expected outcomes of important decisions at the time they're made, we create a valuable feedback loop that helps us identify patterns in our thinking and avoid common cognitive biases.</p>
            
            <p>The journal becomes particularly valuable months or years later, when outcomes have materialized. We can compare our expectations against reality, learning not just from results, but from the quality of our thinking process.</p>
