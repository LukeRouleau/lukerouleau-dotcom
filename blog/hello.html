            <h2>What is "you", and where does it reside?</h2>
            <p>The information filter which you've acquired through a lifetime of experience. 
                The sum of all the things you've seen, heard, felt, and thought boiled down into a lens which weaves together 
                preconscious stimuli into the world-model you uniquely inhabit. Infinity must be down-sampled into something our 
                finite brain matter can process.
            </p>

            <p>What do you miss? What do you assume which is not?</p>
            
            <p>Have you ever sat stone-still for long enough to feel the sense of self-identity relax? Have you looked at 
                outstretched hands and wondered where, precisely, in this flesh you reside? Can you pin it down?
            </p>
