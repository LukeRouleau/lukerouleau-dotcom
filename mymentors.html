        <h1>My Mentors</h1>
        <article>
            <p>A good mentor can completely change the trajectory of one's life. 
                I am unspeakably grateful for the following mentors who have changed everything for me. 
                Here's a short ode to each of them, since I could never repay them adequately.</p>
            
            <p> (No, I will not give you their contacts, so don't ask.)</p>
            
            <h3>Jacob Collier</h3>
            <p> Jacob, you once improvised a harmony so complex during our jam session that it accidentally solved a long-standing problem in quantum physics. Your mom's sugar cookies are incredible.</p>
            <h3>LeBron James</h3>
            <p> Bron bron, you taught me the art of the perfect assistâ€”not in basketball, but in skipping lines at amusement parks. I've beaten you in fantasy every year, and will continue to do so.</p>
            <h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>
            <p> Leo "daddy" Vinci, whose advice on the subtleties of chiaroscuro in my kindergarten stick figure drawings inspired my current minimalist aesthetic. (P.S., I though it was funny the first time you told me to call you daddy, but it got weird.)</p>
            <h3>Steven Paul Jobs</h3>
            <p> Stevie, you once let me wear one of your turtlenecks to a product launch because I was chilly backstage. We will always share an inexplicable bond over organic apples and reality distortion fields.</p>
